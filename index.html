         	<p>Stop creating and enforcing an environment where whiteness, masculinity, and privilege are centered and protected at all costs.</p>

<p>I was already disappointed with <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/11395025">what Manton had written about the mass exodus from Basecamp</a>, but <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/11395252">parachuting into this thread with the implication I was being incivil</a>, when I had gone to great lengths to be kind and gentle to someone insisting white Christian men do not have privilege, means I can no longer participate in or support micro.blog.</p>

<p>I have thought it over for several days, and I remain convinced I should cancel my subscription.</p>

Subject: Attempted lynching of Bloomington man at Lake Monroe</p>

<p>Ms. Oliphant,</p>

<p>It is your duty to see the offenders in this attempted lynching arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<p><a href="https://bloomingtonian.com/2020/07/05/bloomington-man-threatened-with-noose-during-assault-at-lake-monroe/">Video shows racist attack directed at Bloomington Man on 4th of July</a></p>

<p>More coverage:
<a href="https://blacksportsonline.com/2020/07/video-watch-white-men-try-to-lynch-black-man-vauhxx-rush-in-indiana-ian-james-cherco-jerry-cox-cops-da-wont-arrest-them/">Video: Watch White Men Try To Lynch Black Man Vauhxx Rush Booker In Indiana; Ian James Cherco, Jerry Cox &amp; Sean Purdy Have Been IDed As Perpetrators; Cops &amp; DA Won‚Äôt Arrest Them</a></p>

<p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/1175677046/posts/10222147157086001/?d=n">Victim Vauhxx Rush Booker‚Äôs eyewitness account</a></p>

<p>This is obviously a hate crime and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>In Booker‚Äôs own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two of them jumped me from behind and knocked me to the ground. I tussled with the two and another one joined in, then two more. The five were able to easily overwhelm me and got me to the ground and dragged me pinning my body against a tree as they began pounding on my head and ripped off some of my hair, with several of them still on top of my body holding me down. They held me pinned and continued beating me for several minutes seemingly become more and more enraged as they kept trying to seriously injure me and failing. At one point during the attack one of the men jumped on my neck. I could feel both his feet and his full bodyweight land hard against my neck.</p>

<p>At this point the commotion and the sounds one of the men‚Äôs young teenage daughter screaming for her father and the others to let me go started attracting more people, (most whom I didn‚Äôt know) who started attempting to intervene. The attackers told the growing group, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to break his arms‚Äù (while literally attempting to bend my arms behind me) and then stated to the members of their party several times to, ‚Äúget a noose&rdquo;, amongst some other choice slurs. With me still pinned underneath them they kept telling onlookers to leave the, ‚Äúboy‚Äù and that everyone else (all white) could go. Folks then started filming the confrontation, and shouting that they wouldn‚Äôt leave me to be killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine this happening to you. Imagine the rage you would feel if:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When DNR eventually arrived they didn‚Äôt contact us to ensure that no one was injured, instead they went directly to speak with the other individuals (attackers) first. When they finally came to the beach near our campsite where we were all waiting, multiple individuals who didn‚Äôt know each other shared videos and relayed that the individuals had yelled ‚Äúwhite power‚Äù and a litany of other derogatory remarks, and threatened my life multiple times, and also assaulted an approximately 60 year old man who stopped to film the encounter. Yet DNR refused to arrest any of these individuals, even with multiple the witnesses several who filmed the event and collaborated our accounts. Instead the officers stated they contacted the Prosecutor‚Äôs office who relayed there was no immediate need to arrest anyone, and that the officers would simply file a report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bloomington we‚Äôve had three public incidents involving overtly racists individuals who were then backed by the police within a month. Are we going to wait for a Black person to be lying dead in the gutter before we act? When is enough actually enough?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So simply charging the racist lynch mob with assault and attempted murder is not enough in this case. Your office should work to ensure that the officers who responded to this call are relieved of duty, and their superiors held accountable for their inaction and dereliction of their responsibility to public safety.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve concluded that <strong>open hardware is precisely as trustworthy as closed hardware</strong>. Which is to say, I have no inherent reason to trust either at all. While open hardware has the opportunity to empower users to innovate and embody a more correct and transparent design intent than closed hardware, at the end of the day any hardware of sufficient complexity is not practical to verify, whether open or closed. Even if we published the complete mask set for a modern billion-transistor CPU, this ‚Äúsource code‚Äù is meaningless without a practical method to verify an equivalence between the mask set and the chip in your possession down to a near-atomic level without simultaneously destroying the CPU.</p>

<p><code>.logo__cursor</code> hides the blinky ‚Äúcursor,‚Äù down with all blinky things</p>

<p><code>.logo__mark</code> gets rid of the &gt; shaped SVG thing in front of the site name</p>

<p><code>.footer .copyright span:first-child</code> hides the incorrect ‚ÄúPowered by Hugo‚Äù link.</p>

<p><code>body.dark-theme</code> and <code>.dark-theme .header</code> darken the background from <code>#292a2d</code> and <code>#252627</code> to true black (<code>#000</code>) for enhanced contrast and battery saving on mobile devices with OLED screens. To make the light theme header transparent, which looks better and more pleasantly minimal to me, we add plain <code>.header</code> in addition to the more specific <code>.dark-theme .header</code>, which we need to override a preexisting more specific <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax">declaration</a>.</p>

<p>Do you think I should PR any of these changes? (See live at <a href="https://m.rdela.com/">m.rdela.com</a>.) Or are they worthy of a new theme? I could alter or remove those elements altogether instead of hiding them. I have a few more ideas for changes to the color and text scale/sizing as well. Suggestions welcome!</p>
